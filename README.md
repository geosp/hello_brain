# Hello Brain

## Description

This project implements the examples outlined by the following trining video [Neural Networks with JavaScript - Full Course using Brain.js](https://youtu.be/6E6XecoTRVo)

## Implementation

The examples implemented currently are:

* color
* count
* market
* brightness
* xor
* restaurants
* addition
* readNumber
* book
* sentiment

The training data is in the `data/training` folder. The resulting neuronet is stored in the `data/neuronet` folder.

1. `npm install`
2. Keep `npm run watch` running or run `npm run build:js` everytime a change is made.
2. `npm start [exmple_name]`
